4. **Controller Functions:**
   - Develop controller functions to handle the logic for each route, maintaining separation of concerns.

### Implementing Authentication Middleware

5. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration and login functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

6. **Authentication Middleware:**
   - Create middleware functions to secure routes and authenticate requests using JWT.

### Testing API Endpoints

7. **Postman Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test all API endpoints using Postman, ensuring correct functionality and error handling.

8. **Backend Functionality Complete:**
   - Achieve a fully functional backend, capable of handling user registration, authentication, and note management.

## Frontend Development

### Setting Up Create-React-App

9. **React.js:**
    - Initialize the frontend using Create-React-App for a quick and efficient setup.

### Creating Pages and Components

10. **Protected and Local Routes:**
    - Implement protected and local routes to control access to certain parts of the app.

11. **Page Creation:

**
    - Develop pages such as login, register, and home, ensuring a seamless navigation experience.
