## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB account for the database (update the connection string in `.env`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddhant51/note-it-frontend.git
   git clone https://github.com/Siddhant51/note-it-backend.git
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd note-it-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd note-it-frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your MongoDB connection string.

## Usage

### Authentication

- Upon registration, users receive a unique JWT token for authentication.
- Use this token in the headers for authenticated API requests.

### Creating Notes

- Click on the "+" button to create a new note.
- Choose a type and provide a title and content.
- Save your note.

### Updating and Deleting Notes

- Click on a note to open it.
- Edit the title or content.
- Save your changes or delete the note.

## Styling and Theming

- Toggle between light and dark themes.

## Responsive Design

- The app is designed to provide a seamless experience on various screen sizes.
- Responsive layout ensures usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Backend Setup

- The backend is hosted on Render.com.
- Ensure the backend API URL is correctly configured in the frontend.

## Frontend Development

- The frontend is built using React.js.
- Components are modularized for easy maintenance and reusability.

## API Endpoints

- The backend exposes endpoints for user registration, authentication, note creation, update, deletion, and note count retrieval.

## Deployment

- Both backend and frontend are hosted on Render.com.
- Ensure CORS is configured to allow communication between frontend and backend.

## Methodology

### Backend Development Workflow

1. **Setting up the Server:**
   - Initialized a Node.js server using Express.
   - Configured middleware for handling JSON requests and enabling CORS.
   - Connected the server to MongoDB using Mongoose.

2. **Creating Routes:**
   - Defined API routes for user registration, authentication, note creation, updates, and deletions.
   - Implemented route protection using a custom authentication middleware.

3. **Controller Functions:**
   - Developed controller functions to handle business logic for each route.
   - Ensured proper validation and error handling.

4. **Testing with Postman:**
   - Tested each API endpoint using Postman for correctness and reliability.
   - Checked the integration between the server and MongoDB.

5. **Full Backend Functionality:**
   - Integrated all components to ensure the entire backend is fully functional.
   - Verified the registration, login, note creation, and manipulation processes.

### Frontend Development Workflow

1. **Setting up Create-React-App:**
   - Initialized the frontend using Create-React-App for a streamlined project structure.
   - Ensured proper folder organization for components, pages, and assets.

2. **Protected and Local Routes:**
   - Implemented protected routes for authenticated users.
   - Set up local routes for navigation between different sections of the app.

3. **Creating Pages and Components:**
   - Developed core pages (login, register, home) to serve as the main app views.
   - Designed reusable components (modal, topbar, sidebar, create, update) for a modular structure.

4. **Fully Functional App Without Styling:**
   - Ensured the app is fully functional without any styling.
   - Focused on functionality before aesthetics.

### CSS Styling Workflow

1. **Simple External CSS:**
   - Utilized simple external CSS for styling, focusing on clarity and maintainability.
   - Employed CSS classes for consistent styling across components.

2. **CSS Variables for Dynamic Styling and Theming:**
   - Incorporated CSS variables for dynamic theming, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes.
   - Ensured a cohesive and visually appealing design.



3. **Fully Styled App:**
   - Styled each component and page for a polished user interface.
   - Strived for a responsive design to cater to various screen sizes.

### Hosting Workflow

1. **Render.com Setup:**
   - Hosted the frontend as a static website on Render.com.
   - Configured parameters, rules, and environment variables for a smooth deployment.

2. **Web Service for Backend:**
   - Hosted the backend as a web service on Render.com.
   - Specified environment variables and ensured proper configuration.

### Testing and Corrections

1. **Functional Testing:**
   - Conducted thorough testing by interacting with all functionalities on the hosted app.
   - Verified user registration, login, note creation, updates, and deletions.

2. **Bug Identification:**
   - Actively sought out bugs and issues in the deployed app.
   - Checked for any discrepancies between local development and hosted environments.

3. **Bug Corrections:**
   - Addressed and fixed identified bugs promptly.
   - Introduced loading placeholders to manage server latency and enhance the user experience.
